<h2>Dawn of the Final Week</h2>

Oh boy it is finally over! (Minus that next test >_<) I've taken a few CS classes during the summer before, but this one was by far the most time consuming and hardest. My experience with this class was pretty good and I did like it overall as a class. The first two projects were really fun to work on, but the last three projects I could have gone without. I think the last three projects' idea is great, but a lack of holding team members accountable for their part kinda screwed over my team. Along with the fact that my team wasn't the best when it came to communicating. For team building I would have to say 439's pintos was a heck of alot easier than the website to be honest. Overall, this class was worth it and I think if you are going to take a class Professor Downing offers I would say take this one in the fall or spring semester. OOP was fun and this was to, but I feel like given the right semester this group project would really teach you how working with a real team feels like. At this point I'm just ranting, but I would say go ahead and take this class if you want to work with a team for a few weeks. Well this is the end I guess. I can't wait to be done with school and outside working in the industry.
