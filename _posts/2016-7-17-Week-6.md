<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

This past week I've been spending an insane amount of time on campus working on phase 2 of our project. Thankfully we were able to get it done and turned in. Working with this many people honestly is freaking stressful. You have to try and get everyone together to work, if there is a lack of communication between the different teams who handle other parts, someone people on a basic level don't really work well together, and someone people don't pull their weight enough so they drag other people down. I think in the future working with teams won't be so bad since there is a bit more accountability and you all don't have to meet during your free time.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

What currently is in my way would be now I'm taking three classes while this one is going on. I've got a project due in Mobile Computing that is coming along pretty nicely and I've got a test in my Number Theory class on friday. Other than that the only other thing that is in my way is when I try and relax for too long.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

This week I pray we finish the third phase and I will wrap up my project in Mobile Computing.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

Tip of the week is to have backups. Make sure to have backup plans in case something goes bad and even if you have backups make sure to have backups for your backups.
