<h1>STUFF</h1>

So this last week I've been working the Collatz project in CS 373. The problem main is that you want to find the max cycle length between a specfic number range. The idea of this is pretty simple, but trying to opitimize this simple idea is a nightmare in itself. Since we are trying to submitted to Sphere our code has to run at a certain speed to be accepted. I've taken one of Professor Downing classes before (OOP CS something) so I have C++ that gets accepted by Sphere. The funny thing is my C++ code isn't optimized really at all (I have a cache of size 10,000 and I don't even use >> for the divison). After spending more hours than I really should I still don't have code that is accepted to Sphere. I'm starting to think Sphere wants a blood sacfire or my first born before it will accept the code. Overall, the project has been pretty fun so far minus Sphere being a pain with accepting my code.
