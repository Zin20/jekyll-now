<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

The past week I've been working with my team via slack to get project 3 up and running. At the moment it is a little bit confusing since we have about six people but we really don't have a structured or organized team with it comes to it (at least I don't feel like it). I'm heading the GUI for the project and it is a little much seeing as you have to wait on the data so you know what you can make graphics for. Other than that I think the team works pretty well together even though we were a little overwhelmed with the lack of direction. 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

At this very second the only thing that is in my way was my previous commitments with friends to go out and do things for 4th of July and I'm out of town until the day project 3 is due.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

This week I will finish up some basic design for the website and touch them up once we get the data we need. Other things I will be doing during this week will be start working on the alpha of my app for Mobile Computing which will be a a infinite running where you try and survival for as long as you can.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

Tip of the week is that learn how to balance between school and your friends. It is a crazy time when you are trying to balance your personal life and your professional life. If you know how to balance this then your life will be a heck of alot easier on you.
