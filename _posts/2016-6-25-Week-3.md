<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

I finished up project 2 and I've started to study for the test on Monday. Other than that I've been doing some class work for Mobile Computing. The last week in Mobile Computing was poster week so it was pretty chill, but it will soon start ramping up. Stuff that isn't class work I've been watching the new season of Orange is the new Black from Netflix. 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

As of right now the last thing in my way is the last episode of Game of Thrones then it is done for a year. With that done I won't have an excuse anymore to not really do much on Sundays. 

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Most likely starting on Project 3 with my team. In Mobile Computing we should start having to do write ups for the apps that we’ve chosen to do. In the next week or so my other summer class should start and for about 3 weeks my life will be kinda crazy until this class ends.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

Tips of the week are starting to getting harder and harder to think of. I guess for these Tests you really want to go off and just write code. Write a lot of it and when you think you are fine.. write even more code just to make sure. From my experiences the test will ask us to write some code and then ask us to write tests for the code we’ve just written.
