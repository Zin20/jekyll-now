<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>

So for the past week I've been working on project 2 and trying to manage Mobile Computing and this class. The second assignment was different than the one we did in OOP, but I found this one to be more enjoyable than Australian Voting. It was really cool trying to predict someone's rating based on a bunch of other information though I do wish we went more over how to do it than just throwing us to the wolves. Working with a partner was a fun experience seeing as you get to learn a bit about that person and you form some kind of friendship with them seeing as its both your tails on the line.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>

Currently what's in my way is that I have two posters due tomorrow in Mobile Computer and I really haven't started them yet. I also really want to watch Game of Thrones and see what happened this week.  	

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>

Next week I will relax a little bit such a lot of my projects are due on Monday and Tuesday. So once those days are done I will try and get back into my rhythm of doing work a bit earlier than I normally do.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

Do paired programming. It's a nice way to make some friends in CS and makes projects a lot easier to handle. Other than that learn how to start working early so that you don't run into wanting to watch Game of Thrones and not being able to due to other commitments.
